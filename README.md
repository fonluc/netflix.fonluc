<h4>
ðŸ’¡ During the project development, the teacher encouraged me to make changes to the page structure and new implementations, so I was able to insert a teaser of the featured film on the home screen.</h4>

<h5>ðŸ›  Technologies Involved:</h5>

- CSS3;
- JavaScript.

<h5>ðŸ’» Techniques Used:</h5>

Among other techniques, the video insertion feature was used as a static background on the page, giving the project a more elegant look.
